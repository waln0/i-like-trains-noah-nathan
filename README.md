## Overview

I Like Trains is a multiplayer, real-time, network game where trains controlled by computer programs compete. Programs are
written in Python and Pygame is used to render the playing field. Programs score points by collecting and dropping off
passengers. The more passengers a train is carrying, the longer and slower it becomes. Programs are therefore expected
to implement various strategies and avoid collisions.

Students start by modifying client/agent.py. Additional files can be added to the client/ directory but don't modify the
other existing files in the client/ directory.

The student also have to implement draw_passengers() and draw_trains() functions in client/renderer.py to display the
passengers and trains.


## Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12.9
- Pygame 2.6.1

### 1. (Optional) Start a local server for testing

The student can start a local server by executing `python server/server.py`. This will start a server on the default port (5555) of his computer.
The student can then open another terminal, go to the project folder, enter the virtual environment, and execute `python client/client.py` to connect to the local server. This is optional, but recommended for testing before connecting to the remote server.

### 2. Execute the client

To execute the client and connect to the server. Replace `<ip_adress>` with the IP address of the server (do not enter an IP address if you are connecting to a local server hosted on your machine).

```bash
python client/client.py <ip_adress>
```

## How to Play

1. Launch your client: `python client/client.py <ip_adress>`.
2. Enter your player name and sciper.
3. Wait in the waiting room until all players are connected.
4. Press SPACE to start the game when all players are ready if it is not automatic.
5. Your agent will automatically control your train.

The goal is to collect as many passengers (your number of wagons will increase) and then deliver them to the delivery zone.
The train cannot change its direction to the opposite, only to the left or right.


## Documentation

### Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

#### 1. Server (folder `server/`)
The server is responsible for managing client connections and game synchronization. It is executed on a remote machine which the student is connecting to.
The server files are included here so the student can have a better understanding of how the management of the game works. 

- `server.py` : Manages client connections and game synchronization.
- `game.py` : Contains the main game logic.
- `train.py` : Defines the Train class and its behaviors.
- `passenger.py` : Manages passenger logic.
- `ai_client.py` : Manages AI clients (when a player disconnects).
- `delivery_zone.py` : Manages delivery zones.

#### 2. Client (folder `client/`)
The client is responsible for managing the game display and user interactions. It is executed on the student's machine when executing `client/client.py`.

- `client.py` : Manages server connection and the main game loop.
- `network.py` : Manages network communication with the server.
- `renderer.py` : Responsible for the graphical display of the game.
- `event_handler.py` : Manages events (keyboard inputs).
- `game_state.py` : Maintains the game state on the client side.
- `base_agent.py` : Defines the base agent class.
- `agent.py` : Controls the player's train behavior.
- `ui.py` : Manages the user interface to enter train name and sciper.


### How the client data is updated from the server

1. The server hosts the room and calculates the **game state** (information from the server about the game, like the trains positions, the passengers, the delivery zones, etc.)
2. The client connects to the remote server (by default on localhost:5555)
3. The client sends its **train name** and **sciper** to the server
4. The server regularly sends the game state to the clients, and also listens to potential actions (change direction or drop wagon) from the clients to influence the game.
5. The client receives the game state in the `network.py` and updates the agent's game state from the `handle_state_data()` method in `game_state.py`.
6. This method then calls `update_agent()` (inherited by the `Agent` class from the `BaseAgent` class) to ask for a new direction the agent has to determine.
7. The `update_agent()` method then calls the method `get_direction()` to dynamically calculate the next direction the train should take according to the game state (where are the other trains, the walls, the passengers, the delivery zones, etc.) and send it to the server (`self.network.send_direction_change(direction)`).
8. The server updates the game state and the cycle continues.

### Agent class

The Agent class inherits from the `BaseAgent` class. You can find the implementation of the `BaseAgent` class in `client/base_agent.py`. 
The class is initialized with the following parameters:

- `self.agent_name` : The name of the agent.
- `self.network` : The network object to handle communication.
- `self.logger` : The logger object.
- `self.is_dead` : Whether the agent/train is currently dead or alive.

And the following attributes:

- `self.death_time` : The time when the agent last died.
- `self.respawn_cooldown` : The cooldown time before respawning.
- `self.waiting_for_respawn` : Whether the agent is waiting for respawn.
- `self.game_width` and `self.game_height` are initialized later by the server but are still accessible in the program. They are the width and height of the game grid.

This parameters and attributes are not supposed to be modified. They are updated by the client, receiving the game state from the server. Modifying them may lead to a desynchronization between the information of the client and the real game state managed by the server.
On the other hand, attributes can be added to the Agent class to store additional information (related to your agent strategy).

## Implementation Tasks

As a student, you must implement two main components:

### 1. Intelligent Agent (agent.py)

You must implement an intelligent agent that controls your train. The main method to implement in `client/agent.py` is:

```python
def get_direction(self, game_width, game_height):
    """
    This method is regularly called by the client to get the next direction of the train.
    """
```

#### Methods ideas

You can use such following method ideas (these are examples, not mandatory):
- `will_hit_wall()` : To check if the next position will hit a wall.
- `will_hit_train_or_wagon()` : To check if the direction leads to a collision.
- `get_target_position()` : To take a decision between targetting a passenger or a delivery zone.
- `get_direction_to_target()` : To determine the best direction to reach a target.

#### Using the network to send actions

The agent can also call the method `self.network.send_drop_wagon_request()` to send a request to the server to drop a wagon.
The train will then get a 0.25sec *1.5 speed boost and enter a 10sec boost cooldown. Calling this method will drop one wagon from the train (costing 1 point from the train's score).

### 2. Graphical Rendering (renderer.py)

You must implement the display of trains and passengers in the renderer. The two methods to implement are:

```python
def draw_trains(self):
    """
    Draws all trains and their wagons.
    Tip: Use train_data["position"] to access a train's position
    """

def draw_passengers(self):
    """
    Draws all passengers on the grid.
    Tip: Use passenger["position"] to access a passenger's position
    """
```

## Implementation Tips

1. For the agent:
   - Display the attributes in the logger to understand their structure (self.all_trains, self.all_passengers, self.delivery_zones, etc.).
   - Start with changing the direction if the next position will hit a wall.
   - Implement a simple strategy (e.g., go towards the closest passenger).
   - Gradually add obstacle avoidance (other trains and wagons).
   - Consider handling cases where the direct path is blocked.

2. For the renderer:
   - Ensure trains and passengers should be clearly visible.
   - Each train has a color by default, consider using dark blue to display yours (override the color if the train is yours).

### Other tools in client.py

Some constants are available in the client for debugging:

- `MANUAL_SPAWN`: Automatic respawn when available. False by default, otherwise the player has to press the space bar.
- `ACTIVATE_AGENT`: Activate the agent. True by default. If set to False, the agent will not be used.
- `MANUAL_CONTROL`: Activate manual control. False by default, otherwise the player can use the keyboard arrows to control the train.

### Logging System

The game uses Python's built-in logging system to help with debugging and monitoring. Change the logging level in the `logging.basicConfig` function at the beginning of each file from which you want to follow the logs.

Available log levels (from most to least verbose):

- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging.
- INFO: General information about game operation.
- WARNING: Indicates potential issues.
- ERROR: Serious problems that need attention.
- CRITICAL: Critical errors that prevent the game from running.

Logs are displayed in the console and include timestamps, module name, and log level.
